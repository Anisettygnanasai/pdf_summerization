# PDF Summarization App üìÑ

This is a Streamlit application that allows you to upload a PDF file and get a concise summary using the power of Google's Generative AI.

## ‚ú® Features

  * **PDF Upload:** Easily upload your PDF document.
  * **Intelligent Summarization:** The app processes the text from the PDF and generates a summary using the Gemini family of models.
  * **User-Friendly Interface:** Built with Streamlit for a simple and intuitive user experience.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

The application uses the `pypdf` library to extract text from the PDF. This text is then passed to the Google Generative AI API, which uses a large language model to produce a summary. The entire process is orchestrated using the `langchain` framework to handle the document loading, splitting, and communication with the AI model.
